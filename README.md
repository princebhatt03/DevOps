# 🚀 DevOps Learning Repository

Welcome to my **DevOps Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains my hands-on practice, notes, and projects as I explore and master various **DevOps tools, platforms, and best practices**.  

The repo is organized into multiple folders, each focusing on a specific DevOps technology or concept like **AWS, Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and more**.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
├── AWS/ # Cloud computing, EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, etc.
├── Docker/ # Docker basics, images, containers, volumes, networks
├── Kubernetes/ # Pods, Deployments, Services, Helm charts
├── Terraform/ # Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
├── Ansible/ # Configuration Management, Playbooks, Roles
├── Jenkins/ # CI/CD pipelines and automation
├── Git-GitHub/ # Git commands, branching strategies, GitHub Actions
├── Linux/ # Shell scripting, permissions, system monitoring
├── Monitoring/ # Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
└── Notes/ # Theory, guides, and personal documentation
```

Each folder includes **step-by-step examples, configuration files, scripts, and notes** to reinforce concepts.
